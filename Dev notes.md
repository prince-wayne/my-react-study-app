# Developer Notes 

**Project Summary:**

This project serves as a hands-on exploration into the world of React, designed to deepen my understanding of component-based architecture and state management. Through building this app, I'm honing essential skills like handling props, managing state, and implementing error boundaries. Each feature is crafted with the goal of solidifying concepts in real-world scenarios, allowing me to transform theory into practice. As I progress, this project will evolve, reflecting my growing proficiency in React and front-end development as a whole.

I would also like to add that in no way am i focused on styles as im only here to learn react and node.js. however, there might be times when i chose to style a compondent.

**Project Goal**

I wish to learn `React` and `Node.js` to increase my value as a developer. 

Our first standard, `minor` should be the `Time Tracking Dashboard` that we build with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`, in our past.

Later, our standard would be `Production`, where we build out / update our `Portfolio` website.

once we've rebuild the site with react we can offically mark the langauge as learned or `green` on our offical website.


**Projects Notes**

it could be consider preventive maintance to wrap things in try and catch loops, mainly because when a compondent throws an error and stops the code, we don't get the same logs as we do in raw `HTML`, `CSS`, `Js` sites.

Also make sure when you use the defualt prototypes you type it out correctly. we made this mistake more than enough times...

We should check out that `Root.render` line of code in `index.js`.




**Future Items**

we are currently using a feature that will be `removed` as a part of an update. `default props` they will be changed to this inline version which is simplier but not teached in our current course. So we won't be using it because i wanna do something fun.
